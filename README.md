# Pyrocast

![Pyrocast logo](figures/pyrocast_logo_colour.png)

## Introduction

Pyrocast is a end-to-end machine learning pipeline for the prediction of extreme and dangerous wildfires. More specifically the code in this repository allows you to find, forecast and understand the causal drivers of pyrocumolonimbus clouds, precursors the most large and unpredictable wildfires. The pipeline includes:

* `loaders` to download and format the data
* `nrl_algorithm` to find pyrocumolonimbus clouds and label the data
* `models` to forecast the pyrocumolonimbus clouds
* `icp` to understand the causal drivers of the pyrocumolonimbus clouds

The code for this repository is currently incomplete, the authors are contributing to the repository in their spare time so please be patient.
